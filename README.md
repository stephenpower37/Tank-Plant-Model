# Tank-Plant-Model
The objective of this Model-Based Development assignment was to model a tank filling process and develop a control system to maintain the level of liquid in the tank. A plant model of the tank was developed using Simulink. Once the model was set up, verification and validation tests were undertaken on the model to test that there was no bugs and that the model produced expected results. A detailed report on how the model was set up and how the tests were undertaken can be found below.
